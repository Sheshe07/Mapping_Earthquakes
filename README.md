# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary
Basil and Sadhana were imprested with the earthquake map that I previously created for them. I I created a two different map with a earthquake overlay. They were about to see exactly what they were looking for in the maps. However, they made a new request. They asked me to create a new map so the can see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on additional map.
